Hey there! I'm Mihai Dancaescu, but I usually go by 'yakuhito'.

I'm going to start studying at [Minerva University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva_University) this September, so don't hesitate to send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yakuh1t0) if you're in San Francisco and would like to meet up.

I'm currently working on [GreenWeb.js](https://github.com/Yakuhito/GreenWeb.js) and [FireAcademy.io](https://fireacademy.io/). I'm always open to discuss anything about the [Chia](https://www.chia.net/) ecosystem (and I love alpha!).
