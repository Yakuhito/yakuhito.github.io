Hey there! I'm Mihai Dancaescu, but I usually go by 'yakuhito'.

I'm a student at [Minerva University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva_University), so don't hesitate to send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yakuh1t0) if you're in San Francisco and would like to meet up.

I'm currently working on [FireAcademy.io](https://fireacademy.io/). I'm always open to discuss anything about the [Chia](https://www.chia.net/) ecosystem (and I love alpha!).
