You've somehow managed to reach a part of the Internet about me. Also see: [Books I've Read](https://books.kuhi.to).

## General Background
I'm an 18 year old high school student from Romania. I grew up in a loving family, surrounded by all kinds of animals: cats, dogs, fish, birds (two crows, a cuckoo<!-- that sounds funny --> and a seagull), snakes, frogs, tortoise, and an iguanna.

I used to be a straight-A student in middle school, but that was a long time ago. While I still take some subjects<!-- kind of --> seriously (e.g. Maths), I can't say I'm a good student in all of my classes.

I also play the guitar - I'm still a beginner, so asking me to play something is the equivalent of making a death threat.

I usually try to stay active - before the pandemic, I used to go to the gym. After the quarantine started, I limited myself to running a few times per week (unless it's too cold). I'm now training for a half marathon.

## Cybersecurity
In case the posts on this blog aren't enough: I love doing cool stuff with computers, especially breaking other people's cool stuff. I started playing CTFs in 9th grade, when two of my classmates convinced me to play [picoCTF 2018](https://ctftime.org/event/681) with them. Our team, Penteract, managed to get the 692nd place. A few weeks later, one of those colleagues and I participated at DevHacks 2018 (in the cybersecurity section), where I met what would later become [C0Br@](https://ctftime.org/team/70205) and one mentor whom I'm still in contact with.

The next 'milestone' came when I managed to get selected for my country's European CyberSecurity Competition (ECSC) team in 2019. I met a lot of very interesing people during the two bootcamps and Romania managed to win the 1st place during the finals.

After the finals were over, I started taking interest in pentesting. I managed to [pass the OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/meet-mihai-16-year-old-oscp-holder/) and then proceeded to [take](https://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/offensive-security-awae-oswe-review/) [AWAE](https://blog.kuhi.to/offsec-awae-oswe-review) and get the [OSCE](https://blog.kuhi.to/offsec-ctp-osce-review) just before it 'retired'.

At the start of 2021, I decided that I wanted to become an [OSCE3](https://www.credly.com/badges/47dd7abe-936c-4f87-809b-cd35a23661e0). After taking and passing the exams for [OSED](https://blog.kuhi.to/offsec-exp301-osed-review) and [OSEP](https://twitter.com/yakuh1t0/status/1428294469242265603?s=20), I attained my goal and became the youngest OSCE3. 

That's pretty much it! Thanks for reading :)
