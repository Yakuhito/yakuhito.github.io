Hey there! I'm Mihai Dancaescu, but I usually go by 'yakuhito' - or 'yak' if you're in a hurry.

Currently, I'm knee-deep in the Natural Sciences College at [Minerva University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva_University), where Iâ€™m pursuing a concentration called 'Cells and Organisms.'

In the past few years, I've been pretty active in the [Chia](https://www.chia.net/) ecosystem. Here are some of my highlights:
- [FireAcademy.io](https://fireacademy.io/), the chain's first RPC provider
- [TibetSwap](https://v2.tibetswap.io/), the chain's first AMM
- [warp.green](https://www.warp.green/), a cross-chain messaging protocol between Chia and Base/Ethereum (the chain's first bridge)

Before that, I was extremely passionate about security. I obtained my [OSCE3](https://www.credly.com/badges/47dd7abe-936c-4f87-809b-cd35a23661e0) just a few days before turning 18 (you know, when OffSec was cool) - making me the youngest person to get it. I was a member of HTsP and helped organize a few CTFs - [X-MAS CTF 2019](https://ctftime.org/event/926) being the one I'm most proud of. I was also part of Team Romania in the context of the [European CyberSecurity Challenge](https://ecsc.eu/) for 4 years - 2 of which I was selected captain.
