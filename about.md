Hey there! I'm Mihai Dancaescu, but I usually go by 'yakuhito'.

I'm currently a student at [Minerva University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva_University), where I study Natural Sciences. My concentration is called 'Cells and Organisms.'

In the past few years, I've been pretty active in the [Chia](https://www.chia.net/) ecosystem. Some of my projects:
- [FireAcademy.io](https://fireacademy.io/), the chain's first RPC provider
- [TibetSwap](https://v2.tibetswap.io/), the chain's first AMM
- [warp.green](https://www.warp.green/), a cross-chain messaging protocol between Chia and Base/Ethereum (the chain's first bridge)
