"What are you doing right now?" - that's pretty hard to answer. I'm not sure the exact moment 'now' refers to for you, so here are some of my ongoing activities. This page was last updated on Feb 23rd 2021.


## Super-duper Secret Project
I'm working on something (completely unrelated to infosec), but I'm not ready to 'launch it' yet. I'll update this page when I have more details :)


## CTFs
I'll always be a member of [HTsP](https://ctftime.org/team/58218) - as I've said many times before, they're like a second family to me. That being said, I'm also a member of a newer team, [CodWer](https://ctftime.org/team/140521) - if you see us at a contest, don't hesitate to say 'hi'!


## Guitar
No, I haven't given up yet! I'm still a beginner, so I would really appreciate if you didn't ask me to play anything.


## Reading a book
I enjoy reading books. I prefer the physical/paper version, although I have to read some digitally since I'm not buying anything from Amazon. You can find reviews on some of the books I've read [here](https://books.kuhi.to).


## Feeding my animals
I currently have cats, dogs, and some fish. There's a good chance I'm feeding some of them right now. My sister also owns a few frogs, but thankfully I don't have to feed them. <!-- Thankfully I don't need to feed neither the frogs nor my sister. -->


## Spending time on Twitter
There's a reason my Twitter profile can be found at the bottom of any page on this blog. While I don't use Facebook or Instagram, I've met so many interesting people on Twitter that I've decided not to quit. I hate the 'personal brand' thingy people do, so most of my tweets are not serious. <!-- 99.9% are shitposts -->


## Sleeping
There's a ~30% probability that I'm sleeping in this exact moment. <!-- Notice that I didn't even say 33% -->
